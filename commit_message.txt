Fix bug in which alternate divisors were not used

This commit updates the code in the fizzbuzz_for_num method to
start using the fizz_divisor and buzz_divisor parameters that
were added to the method signature in a previous commit

Verified the fix by running existing tests in test_fizzbuzz.py
which were previously failing and now are all passing
